cd heroku-datadog-drain-go
heroku create
heroku config:set ALLOWED_APPS=<your-app-slug> <YOUR-APP-SLUG>_PASSWORD=<password>
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku drains:add https://<your-app-slug>:<password>@<this-log-drain-app-slug>.herokuapp.com/ --app <your-app-slug>
```


## Configuration

    ALLOWED_APPS=my-app,..    # Required. Comma separated list of app names allowed to send to this drain
    <APP-NAME>_PASSWORD=..    # Required. One per allowed app where <APP-NAME> corresponds to an app name from ALLOWED_APPS
